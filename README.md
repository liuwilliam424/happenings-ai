### Event Classifier

The Event Classifier is the core of our AI engine, designed to generate a comprehensive list of tags for each event based on its title and description. These tags facilitate accurate and detailed classification, making it easier to recommend and search for events.

#### How It Works:
- **Input:** An event title and description.
- **Process:** Utilizes OpenAI's API to generate a broad list of relevant tags. For instance, an event titled "First Game of Playoffs" with the description "Join us for a fantastic beginning of playoffs. Soccer has never been more exciting!" might generate tags such as “sports, soccer, competition, playoffs, games, kickoff, tournament, athletic, competitive, championship, match.”
- **Output:** A list of relevant tags for each event.

### Recommendation Engine

Our Recommendation Engine personalizes event suggestions based on your interests and past event attendance. By leveraging the tags generated by the Event Classifier, we ensure that your event recommendations align with your preferences.

#### How It Works:
- **Input:** A list of your interests and a list of events you have previously attended.
- **Process:** Combines tags from your interests and previous events, then runs them through our search function to find relevant events.
- **Output:** A curated list of recommended events displayed on your personalized landing page.

### Search Function

The Search Function allows you to effortlessly find events by matching your search queries with event titles and tags. Additionally, it generates related tags to ensure you discover the most relevant events, even if your query is not specific.

#### How It Works:
- **Input:** A search query.
- **Process:** Matches the query with event titles and tags, and generates a list of possible related tags.
- **Output:** A list of matching events, displayed with their title, description, start time, and location.
